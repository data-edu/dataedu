The goal of {dataedu} is to provide readers of [Data Science in
Education Using
R](https://github.com/data-edu/data-science-in-education) with a package
with useful functions, data, and references from the book.

## Installation

### 1. Install {pak}

First, let’s install {pak}. If you already have {pak} installed, you can
move on to the next step.

``` r
install.packages("pak")
```

### 2. Install {dataedu}

You can install the development version of {dataedu} by running this in
your RStudio console:

``` r
pak::pak("data-edu/dataedu")
```

#### Important Notes on Installation

- {dataedu} requires R 3.6 or above to be installed.

- {dataedu} has other packages that it needs to be able to run. You can
  see the full list under “Imports” (imported when downloading the
  package) and “Suggests” (we think you should include these too!) in
  the [DESCRIPTION
  file](https://github.com/data-edu/dataedu/blob/master/DESCRIPTION#L34).

- **We recommend first checking to see if your packages are all
  up-to-date if you are running into issues with installation.** If you
  have installed the imported/suggested packages previously and have not
  updated them in a while, RStudio may prompt you to update them. You
  can choose to (1) ignore this prompt, (2) exit the prompt and update
  your packages, or (3) try to update your packages through the prompt.
  It’s usually easier to exit and update your packages outside the
  prompt (one way to do this is to go to the RStudio Packages pane and
  click Update, then select the packages you’d like to update).

### 3. Call the Package

Before you can use the package, make sure to call it using `library()`:

``` r
library(dataedu)
```

## Package Contents

We created this package to provide our readers an opportunity to jump
into R however they see fit.

1.  [Mass installation of all the packages used in the
    book](#mass-installation-of-packages)
2.  [Reproducible code for the
    walkthroughs](#reproducible-code-for-walkthroughs)
3.  [Access to the data used in each of the
    walkthroughs](#accessing-the-walkthrough-data)
4.  [The dataedu theme and color palette for
    reuse](#using-the-dataedu-theme-and-palette)

### Mass Installation of Packages

We strived to use packages that we use in our daily work when creating
the walkthroughs in the book. Because we covered a variety of subjects,
that means we used a lot of packages! As described in the Foundational
Skills chapter, you can install the packages individually as they suit
your needs.

However, if you want to get started quickly and download all the
packages at once, please use `install_dataedu()`.

``` r
dataedu::install_dataedu()
```

To see the packages used in the book, run:

``` r
dataedu::dataedu_packages
#>  [1] "apaTables"   "caret"       "dummies"     "e1071"       "ggraph"     
#>  [6] "here"        "janitor"     "lme4"        "lubridate"   "performance"
#> [11] "ranger"      "readxl"      "rtweet"      "randomNames" "sjPlot"     
#> [16] "textdata"    "tidygraph"   "tidylog"     "tidyverse"   "tidytext"
```

**A special note on {tabulapdf}:** One of the walkthroughs uses
[tabulapdf](https://docs.ropensci.org/tabulapdf/index.html), created by
ROpenSci to read PDFs. {tabulapdf} requires the installation of
[RJava](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rJava/index.html), which
can be a tricky process. {tabulapdf} is not included in
`install_dataedu()` and we recommend reading through the notes on its
Github repo if installing.

### Accessing the Walkthrough Data

To get the data, run `dataedu::` then the dataset as it is named in the
book:

``` r
dataedu::course_data
```

To see all the datasets available in the package, run
`data(package = "dataedu")`.

``` r
# this is to print the results for the README
# only `data(package = "dataedu")` is needed to see this list
a <- data(package = "dataedu")
a$result[ , 3:4]
#>       Item

```

If you would like to download the data in non-`.Rds` (RData) format, the
CSV and JSON formats are available under
[`inst/extdata`](https://github.com/data-edu/dataedu/tree/master/inst/extdata).
Please note that `all_files` is not included because of how large the
file would be.

### Using the {dataedu} Theme and Palette

Add the theme and palette to ggplot2-based plots using `theme_dataedu()`
and `scale_*_dataedu()`.

- **Note:** The DataEdu theme uses {showtext} to render the font. If you
  would like to use it in an R markdown chunk, please ensure that the
  chunk lists `fig.showtext = TRUE`. If you would like to use it in a
  standalone R script, then you will need to use a differnet graphic
  device. More information is available in the documentation
  [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/showtext/vignettes/introduction.html).

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(dataedu)

ggplot(midwest, aes(x = area, y = popdensity, color = state)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_dataedu() +
  scale_color_dataedu()
```

The font for the DSIEUR graphs is Cabin and available
[here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin). The code to load the
font with the package is heavily based on the code from Guangchuang Yu’s
[extrafont](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/emojifont) package - thank
you!
